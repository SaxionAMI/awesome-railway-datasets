# Awesome railway datasets [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)
Curated list of publically available railway related datasets captured with point cloud data.

## WHU-Railway3D
This dataset provides semantic segmentation labels for 11 different classes. Three different kinds of environments are captured: urban, rural and plateau. Each environment is captured with a different sensor type. Each environments consists of 10 km of track.
